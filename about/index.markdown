<h3>Victor, (real name Vu Tran Huy) an enthusiastic Ruby programmer.</h3>

<img src="/images/myself.png" class="right" style="width: 150px;" />
I have big passion on programming and programming languages expecially Ruby. I'm working full-time with Ruby and contribute to Ruby open source projects.

I often try and do experiments on different programming languages considering studying new programming languages are my personal challenges.

I was lead programmer at <a href="truongnha.com">TruongNha</a>, co-founder of Softemy (a freelancer group in Vietnam). I'm currently CTO at ClickLion - a startup company.

I read books, blogs, articles and play games (Dota) in my spare time.

My interests: <em>Programming Languages</em>, <em>Machine Learning</em>, <em>Data structure & Algorithm</em>.

<h3>What would I post on this blog?</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Technical notes during my daily works</li>
 <li>Must read links related to my works</li>
 <li>Interesting things that I experienced during my daily life</li>
</ul>
